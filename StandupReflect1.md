## Reflection 1
 
Within the previous week, my main goal has been understanding what our software is going to act like and how we can go about creating it. I've done some scattered, independent research about what makes a synthesizer a synthesizer. I'm looking for somewhere to start (code wise) and understanding the parts that make a synthesizer (oscillators, amplifiers, filters, etc.) has helped find that. This upcoming week, I want to start develloping oscillators in Python to have a basis for wave creation. There are many parts that make up a synthesizer but this will be a good foundation for it. The only technical issues I feel that I would encounter are in relation to Python, like the packages and libraries we use. The code we plan to create will be heavly math-based. I do not have a Gantt chart currenty, rather the rough timeline in the project proposal. I think that generally, when it comes to improvement that could benefit me, I could take more time out of days to spend collaborating with my groupmates. Learning to collaborate more could be something beneficial to not just me but my group, as I am very independent with my school work in general.

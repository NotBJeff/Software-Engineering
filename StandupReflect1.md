##In the self-reflection, you are to periodically comment on these areas:

- Your individual contributions during the prior sprint
- Your planned individual contributions during the upcoming sprint
- Any technical challenges that you face that are preventing you from achieving your planned contributions to the group
- Any areas for personal and professional development that would better enable you to meet your planned contributions on-schedule
- Provide a screenshot of your Gantt chart tasks and the current state of those tasks. If the Gantt chart does not already assign a point person to each task, indicate that on your reflection report here.
- Your discussion of prior and planned individual contributions should align with the project plan and Gantt chart. They should be generally on-schedule, or a group-led revision to the schedule should take place and be documented. In addition, these contributions should not overlap with the claimed contributions of others. In other words, you should comment on what, specifically, you accomplished during the past sprint (and what you plan to accomplish during the upcoming sprint).
